Hello World ðŸŒŽ - Let's start this journey together. My name is Jide Abdul-Qudus and I'm a Web developer, I have a knack for design, so i create beautiful UIs whenever I'm not coding. 

About a year ago i started my journey into Computer Programming, Taking online tutorials each time i went for my daily work as an intern. 

I decided to learn more on `WebDesign` and `Graphics` over the next year. While i had a slow start to accomplishing my programming goals, learning just HTML & CSS in the first quarter of the year, i later enrolled in the CodeLagos boot-camp to further my knowledge on `WebDesign` whilst attending school.

In the final quarter of the year(2018) i had the opportunity of learning even more than i could imagine with a Dev Job opening, Through constant practice and learning on the job, I grew to become a Full-Stack web developer, with skills in various Web Technologies. 

I'm not stopping here!

`Welcome to my world`
