## Brief 

In the early 2000s, the average human had an attention span of 42seconds, by 2019; `the average human now has an attention span of 8secs` that’s 1 second less than that of a goldfish. Every modern Website/Application makes use of Colors, Motion animations with exquisite Interfaces to get users to interact more and stay tuned on the website.

The concept of the Viruins UI is to blend interactive motion designs with modern Health Technologies leveraging the use of Colors, and Motion to keep the user interested in the application.

## The design Process

Unlike previous works, this UI was rendered without any prior UX research to generate the result. Regardless, it qualifies as an impressive body of work as no particular project reaches perfection.

## Visual Design 

In an attempt to attract as many users as possible, I took my time to learn and understand what it means to have a strong visual design, making sure that the visuals are as good as possible. I worked on a style guide, and onboarding illustrations to assist with this.

1.  The use of a Cold tone to establish an overall sense of tranquility that is necessary to help users concentrate on the more important features of the app.

2. White is often used as the background of apps because it represents reverence, purity, innocence, and nothingness. This association calms people and influences their brain activity in a very positive way.

3. Red/Pink is the color of childhood, tenderness, sensitivity, romance, and health. It is often associated with being taken care of and with babies and mothers, which is why it’s primarily used for designing platforms related to women’s health, childbirth, and Health care.

4. Fonts are another invaluable part of the app’s design. They’re like your business card, your outfit, or the way you style your hair — they represent who you are and what you do. I used a Serif font for this design.

5. Other things I considered are the size of the buttons ( as the average width of an adult fingertip is 10mm ), Interline spacing, Icons e.t.c.

## When to go for wordpress and when to go for gatsby?

So It depends on the use-case when to go for Gatsby and When to go for Wordpress

1. If you have a team of more than 5 non-technical people working for some content marketing company then going for WordPress will be a good idea because gatsby involves a bit of technical work. If you are a javascript developer or a full stack web developer who wants to just build his portfolio and have a blog then gatsby is a good idea if you are maintaining the website by yourself.

2. If cost is not much of your concern and ease of use is your concern then going for wordpress is a good idea. Because Wordpress involves a lot of plugins like wp-bakery, yoast, etc, that makes drag and drop functionality and SEO easier. If cost is your concern and you are ready for some little hard work you can go for Gatsby.

3. If you are planning for an online e-commerce application for small businesses with email marketing then Wordpress is probably a better solution than Gatsby I believe. The reason is you can build an e-commerce website easily with Wordpress. There are many plugins and themes that are available to set up an e-commerce website with Wordpress and you can easily keep track of your leads. The most commonly used Wordpress plugin for e-commerce application is `woocommerce`.

4. SEO and Performance in mind with minimal cost then `Gatsby` is the solution you can build a SPA and PWA applications easily with `Gatsby`. Even Wordpress has some cool plugins like `Yoast` for SEO and there are some very good flexibility while using Wordpress enhancing the SEO without much technical knowledge but you need a very good server to keep the performance of the `Wordpress` site up. If SEO is your concern then you should make sure that your site renders in less then 3 seconds.

## Building a Gatsby application

There are plenty of different ways to build gatsby websites. To start with you can look into official [gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and the tutorials on their [site](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
