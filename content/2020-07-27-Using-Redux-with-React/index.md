excerpt: Explaining how you can use Redux for state management with React.
---

A lot of React developers deal with state management while building there Applications, while some manage the states right on the App component, when building medium or large scale applications it's a better practice to use a State management system like Context or Redux.

This guide shows how to setup and use Redux while dealing with state management in your react application.

# What is Redux?

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

In layman's term `It's a state management system for javascript apps.`

I personally recommend redux for medium/large scale applications and context for small applications.

# How does Redux work?

In Redux, you have to remember 3 things:

1. Action
2. Reducer
3. Store

So in redux, you will create only one store and pass the store in your top most react component. Normally in App Component in src/App.js file or index.js file.
Store holds all the app state or global state for the application in Redux.

As the store will be passed to the React application or view part, we can pass any information or command. This is called action in Redux way. That means, you want to dispatch and action to send some command.

Basically the actions will be dispatched to the reducer which is a fancy term of function. Reducer will get the current state from the store and will use the actions to create new state based on old state and will update in the store.

Finally, if a view component is connected to the store, it will re render when the state in redux store will be updated.

# Getting our codes running

- First step is installing our dependencies.
  <br/> <br/>
  `npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension`
  <br/> <br/>

- Create a `store.js` file inside the src folder of your react app

```html
<script>
  import { applyMiddleware, createStore } from 'redux'
  import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension'
  import thunk from 'redux-thunk'
  import rootReducer from './reducers'

  const initialState = {}
  const middleware = [thunk]
  const store = createStore(
    rootReducer,
    initialState,
    composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(...middleware))
  )
  export default store
</script>
```

<br/><br/>

- Update and connect `App.js` with your store file

```html
<script>
  import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
  import store from './store'

  const App = () => {
    return (
      <Provider store={store}>
        <Fragment>
          <Home />
        </Fragment>
      </Provider>
    )
  }
</script>
```

<br/><br/>

- Create a reducers folder with file `index.js`, this is where all your reducers live

```html
<script>
  import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
  import profileReducer from './profileReducer'

  export default combineReducers({})
</script>
```

All subsequent reducers would be created in the reducers folder and added to the combineReducers bracket
<br/><br/>
- Create Actions folder in src

<br/><br/>

- Create `Types.js` file in Actions folder

```html
<script>
  export const ADD_PROFILE = 'ADD_PROFILE'
</script>
```

<br/><br/>

- Create `profileActions.js` file in Actions folder (profileActions because we are trying to create an action that updates a profile form)

```html
<script>
  import { ADD_PROFILE } from './Types'

  export const addProfile = edit => {
    return {
      type: ADD_PROFILE,
      payload: edit,
    }
  }
</script>
```

<br/><br/>
- Create `profileReducer.js` file in reducers folder

```html
<script>
  import { ADD_PROFILE } from '../actions/Types'

    const initialState = {
        users:[
            {
                id:1,
                name:"John Doe"
            }
        ]
    }

    export default (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_PROFILE:
      return {
        ...state,
        users: [...state.users, action.payload],
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
</script>
```

<br/><br/>

- Update the `index.js` file in reducers folder

```html
<script>
  import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
  import profileReducer from './profileReducer'

  export default combineReducers({ profileReducer: profileReducer })
</script>
```
<br/><br/>

- Try using Redux on your Component of choice

```html
<script>
import React, { useState } from 'react'
  import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux'

  import { addProfile } from '../../../actions/profileActions'

    const Home =()=>{
        const profile = useSelector ((state)=>state.profilereducer)

        return(
            {profile.users.map((user)=>(
                <li>{user.name} is with id: {user.id}</li>
            ))}
        )
    }

    //To dispatch an action you can do 
    <Button onClick ={()=> dispatch(addProfile())}> Add </Button>
</script>
```

# Conclusion 

We now have a fully running react-redux application. New reducers can be created in the reducers folder, actions created in the actions folder then connected to the combineReducers export.
